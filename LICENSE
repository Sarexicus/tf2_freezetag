So you wanna use our prefab to make your own Freeze Tag map? Great! In this document you will find the terms of service for the use of our prefab. By using our prefab in your TF2 maps you agree to adhere to these terms and not break any of them.

1:
Ensure that the FINAL version of the map that you upload to the Steam Workshop is "arena_mapname_ft", and not "ft_mapname" or "arena_ft_mapname" or anything similar. Please note that this only applies for the Final Workshop Release. During map development on servers such as TF2Maps, you are free to have the map name be "ft_mapname", as this can help with team scrambling and balancing issues. (TF2Maps will not allow scrambling of teams on a map with the "arena_" prefix, for example.) Having the final name be "arena_mapname_ft" gives the player immediate clarity of what they will be playing, and what the objective is.

2:
All members of the Freeze Tag team MUST be credited with their roles in the project, as follows:

Freeze Tag created by:
Lo-fi - Project Lead
Sarexicus - Logic Programming
Le Codex - Logic Programming
Yrrzy - Particles

Please put these credits somewhere in your Steam Workshop description. It doesn't matter where, but do not alter any aspect of the credits text. The team have worked dilligently to ensure that Freeze Tag is the BEST it can possibly be, so it is only fair for us to be properly attributed for all of our hard work. This especially applies if your map is selected for use within the game.

3:
Under NO circumstances What So Ever are you allowed or permitted to make edits or changes to the materials, models, gameplay, code or vscript of Freeze Tag. It should really go without saying but Freeze Tag belongs to the Freeze Tag team, and you are prohibited from making ANY alterations of any kind to it. If there is a change that you would like to see implemented (and it is feasible enough for the team to implement it without compromising the integrity of Freeze Tag as a whole) please reach out and ask us, and we'll talk about its inclusion and how we could potentially handle it.

4:
Keep everything consistent between the different variants of Freeze Tag. No matter if you're using the Summer Holograms, the Halloween Statues, or the Smissmas Ice Sculptures version, the gameplay of Freeze Tag should be EXACTLY the same between variants. Any discrepancies between modes will potentially cause confusion, and risks jeopardising the hard work that the team have put into making sure that the game mode is as clear-cut and immediately understandable as possible.

5:
Add a little Tabasco to that bad boy.
